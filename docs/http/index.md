# Using the HTTP API

## POST /api/create

Creates a new module using some WebAssembly code and some unique salt

Accepts a form data with the following fields

- `code` as bytes = your WebAssembly code (your .wasm file)

- `salt` as bytes = some bytes (any length, can be 0) that will be hashed with your code to produce your module address

- `effort` as bytes = some unique 32 bytes whose sha256 `hash` validates `((2n ** 256n) / BigInt("0x" + hash.toHex())) > (code.length + salt.length)`

## POST /api/execute

Execute some function on a module

Accepts a form data with the following fields

- `module` as string = your module address (32-bytes hex)

- `method` as string = WebAssembly function to be executed

- `params` as bytes = WebAssembly function parameters as pack-encoded bytes (see pack encoding below)

- `effort` as bytes =  some unique 32 bytes whose sha256 `hash` whose result in `((2n ** 256n) / BigInt("0x" + hash.toHex()))` will be the maximum number of sparks (gas) used

## POST /api/simulate

Simulate some function on a module (it won't write anything to storage and will execute in mode `2` so verifications such as signatures can be skipped)

Accepts a form data with the following fields

- `module` as string = your module address (32-bytes hex)

- `method` as string = WebAssembly function to be executed

- `params` as bytes = WebAssembly function parameters as pack-encoded bytes (see pack encoding below)

- `effort` as bytes =  some unique 32 bytes whose sha256 `hash` whose result in `((2n ** 256n) / BigInt("0x" + hash.toHex()))` will be the maximum number of sparks (gas) used
